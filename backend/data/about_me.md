## Projects

### Deep Learning Image Classifier
- **Description**: A hands-on dive into computer vision — I built a neural network from scratch in PyTorch that can identify images with 65% accuracy after training on 2,000 examples. It was a great crash course in convolutional layers, model tuning, and seeing deep learning come to life.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, PyTorch
- **Key Features**: 
  - Developed an Image Classifier Neural Network utilizing PyTorch library, demonstrating proficiency in deep learning techniques and artificial intelligence principles.
  - Trained the neural network on a dataset of 2000 images, employing a combination of convolutional, batch normalization, linear, max pooling, and dropout layers to optimize model performance.
  - Achieved an overall 65% accuracy in correctly identifying images through a comprehensive training pipeline including data transformation, loss calculation, and model evaluation.

### Stock Market Analysis App
- **Description**: Imagine combining live market data, financial news, and an AI-powered assistant — that’s what I built. A real-time stock dashboard that streams up-to-the-second data for 1,000+ tickers, while a custom chatbot powered by OpenAI helps users make sense of it all.
- **Technologies Used**: Javascript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, OpenAI API
- **Key Features**:
  - Engineered a real-time stock tracking platform using Polygon.io API, achieving sub-second data updates for over 1,000+ ticker symbols with optimized request handling.
  - Integrated NewsAPI to dynamically fetch and display the top 10 financial articles per user query, enhancing user experience by combining data with news context.
  - Designed and deployed a custom LLM chatbot powered by the OpenAI API to provide stock insights, answer user questions, and analyze real-time data.

### Nonprofit Organization Website
- **Description**: I helped a nonprofit modernize their online presence by building a sleek, full-stack web platform that boosted engagement by 40%. It’s built with React and Node.js, but the real win was making it easy for non-technical users to manage content and grow their community.
- **Technologies Used**: Javascript, React, Node.js
- **Key Features**:
  - Developed a full-stack web platform for a nonprofit organization with over 500 attendees, resulting in a 40% increase in traffic and outreach to sponsors.
  - Implemented a MongoDB schema with Node.js and Express to store and retrieve dynamic content enabling non-technical users to easily update site content, and integrated front-end components using React enhancing development efficiency and consistency.
  - Optimized for performance and mobile responsiveness across browsers and devices, contributing to a 30% increase in returning attendees over the following year.
