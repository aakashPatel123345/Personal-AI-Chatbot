# About Me

## Background
[1-2 short paragraphs about your background, current role, and what you're passionate about]
My name is Aakash Patel, and I have a background in Software Engineering, AI, and Data Engineering. My experience spans developing full stack applications, integrating RESTful APIs, working on AI and ML models, and streamlining data. During my internships, I worked on large datasets, developing scalable applications, and collaborating across cross-functional teams to deliver meaningful results. Overtime, I have become more and more interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. More particularly, how large langauge models and retrieval augmented generation (or RAAG for short) can connect human context with model understanding. I am passionate about everything in Software Engineering and even more passionate developing new projects that push me to learn and expand on my comfort zone. At the core, I am motivated by building technology that is meaningful, intuitive, and can genuinely help people.

## Projects

### Deep Learning Image Classifier
- **Description**: A hands-on dive into computer vision — I built a neural network from scratch in PyTorch that can identify images with 65% accuracy after training on 2,000 examples. It was a great crash course in convolutional layers, model tuning, and seeing deep learning come to life.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, PyTorch
- **Key Features**: 
  - Developed an Image Classifier Neural Network utilizing PyTorch library, demonstrating proficiency in deep learning techniques and artificial intelligence principles.
  - Trained the neural network on a dataset of 2000 images, employing a combination of convolutional, batch normalization, linear, max pooling, and dropout layers to optimize model performance.
  - Achieved an overall 65% accuracy in correctly identifying images through a comprehensive training pipeline including data transformation, loss calculation, and model evaluation.
- **Achievements**: Successfully built and trained a neural network from scratch, gaining hands-on experience with PyTorch, deep learning fundamentals, and computer vision techniques. This project solidified my understanding of how neural networks process visual data and sparked my interest in AI/ML.

### Stock Market Analysis App
- **Description**: Imagine combining live market data, financial news, and an AI-powered assistant — that’s what I built. A real-time stock dashboard that streams up-to-the-second data for 1,000+ tickers, while a custom chatbot powered by OpenAI helps users make sense of it all.
- **Technologies Used**: Javascript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, OpenAI API
- **Key Features**:
  - Engineered a real-time stock tracking platform using Polygon.io API, achieving sub-second data updates for over 1,000+ ticker symbols with optimized request handling.
  - Integrated NewsAPI to dynamically fetch and display the top 10 financial articles per user query, enhancing user experience by combining data with news context.
  - Designed and deployed a custom LLM chatbot powered by the OpenAI API to provide stock insights, answer user questions, and analyze real-time data.

### Nonprofit Organization Website
- **Description**: I helped a nonprofit modernize their online presence by building a sleek, full-stack web platform that boosted engagement by 40%. It’s built with React and Node.js, but the real win was making it easy for non-technical users to manage content and grow their community.
- **Technologies Used**: Javascript, React, Node.js
- **Key Features**:
  - Developed a full-stack web platform for a nonprofit organization with over 500 attendees, resulting in a 40% increase in traffic and outreach to sponsors.
  - Implemented a MongoDB schema with Node.js and Express to store and retrieve dynamic content enabling non-technical users to easily update site content, and integrated front-end components using React enhancing development efficiency and consistency.
  - Optimized for performance and mobile responsiveness across browsers and devices, contributing to a 30% increase in returning attendees over the following year.

## Personal Philosophy / Approach
I approach problem solving with a mix of curiosity, persistence, and structure. I like thinking of problems in different chunks, and enjoy breaking seemingly complex problems into smaller workable parts. Some things I really value are collaboration, communication, and trust. Moreover, I enjoy working with teams in which individuals are always striving to be the best versions of themselves. 

## Personal hobbies and interests
Despite loving to solve problems, code, and learn, I do enjoy various other activies. One of my favorite hobbies is cooking. I love cooking new foods, trying new recipes, and experimenting around in the kitchen. My favorite thing to cook has got to be quesidillas. Quesidillas are a childhood comfort meal for me, and one of the first "meals" I laerned to cook myself, and so it holds a special place in my heart. I also love to run! I participated in track back in high school, and since then have developed an interest in long distance running. I am by no means a seasoned and experienced runner, but one of my biggest life goals is to complete a half marathon one day. 

I also love to watch tv and movies. When I feel lazy sometimes, I often find myself binging my favorite shows. My top three favorite tv shows of all time are Stranger Things, Andor, and Severance. During the later months of the year, I enjoy watching NFL, and my favorite football team is the Denver Broncos.


## Personal background
